# brand-assets
Paladin's brand assets (or at least a subset of them)

## Contribution rules
1. Do not re-name files
2. Do not re-size aspect ratios
3. Avoid re-sizing resolution
4. Prefer adding assets over updating them

TL/DR: This repository gets inherited as a submodule in a lot of our other projects. If you mess with what these projects expect from an image, these applications will start looking weird once they update their brand-assets dependency.
